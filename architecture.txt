Database: MySQL (scalable for multiuser)
Backend: Node.js (Express) -> build the api for the Database and app logic
Frontend: React -> quires my API for quiz questions, leaderboards extract



Python scraper → collects Bundesliga data and writes it into your database.

Node.js backend (Express) → acts as the “API layer” between your database and your frontend, and is responsible for game logic etc

Example: GET /api/seasons/2005/2006 returns all matches from that season.

Example: POST /api/scores saves a player’s quiz result.

React frontend → fetches data only through your Node.js API.

Never talks directly to the database.
